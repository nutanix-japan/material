Note If these are Single Node Clusters (SNCs) pay close attention on the networking part. The SNCs are setup and configured differently to the 3 or 4 node clusters Environment Details Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images,networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises. Networking As we are able to provide three/four node clusters and single node clusters in the HPOC environment, we need to describe each sort of cluster separately. The clusters are setup and configured differently. Three/Four node HPOC clusters Three or four node Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention: Cluster Name - POC XYZ Subnet - 10. 42 . XYZ .0 Cluster IP - 10. 42 . XYZ .37 For example: Cluster Name - POC055 Subnet - 10.42.55.0 Cluster IP - 10.42.55.37 for the VIP of the Cluster Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute XYZ with the correct octet for your subnet, for example: IP Address Description 10.42. XYZ .37 Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP 10.42. XYZ .39 PC VM IP, Prism Central 10.42. XYZ .41 DC VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs: Network Name Address VLAN DHCP Scope Primary 10.42. XYZ .1/25 0 10.42.

The reason for this is to allow more people to have a dedicated cluster but still have enough free clusters for the bigger workshops including those for customers. The network in the SNC config is using a /26 network. This splits the network address into four equal sizes that can be used for workshops. The below table describes the setup of the network in the four partitions. It provides essential information for the workshop with respect to the IP addresses and the services running at that IP address.

As part of the exercise you will publish a pre-configured Blueprint to the local Marketplace, clone the Blueprint from the Marketplace for editing, and launch the application. Publishing Blueprints from Marketplace Manager By default, Calm comes pre-seeded with validated Blueprints for multiple open source and enterprise applications. Marketplace Manager acts as a staging area for publishing default and user-created Blueprints to your local Marketplace. The Marketplace acts as an application store, providing end users with a catalog of available applications. From Prism Central > Calm Select Marketplace Manager from the sidebar. Under Marketplace Blueprints , select Mongo . Tip The Blueprint description contains key information including licensing, hardware requirements, OS, supported platforms, and limitations. Select the Calm project from the right-hand side drop down and Click Publish . Wait for the Blueprint Status to appear as Published . Under Projects Shared With , select the Project you had created earlier and click Apply . :::note If the Projects Shared With drop down menu is unavailable, refresh your browser. ::: Launch Blueprints from Marketplace From Prism Central > Calm , select Marketplace from the sidebar. All Blueprints published in Marketplace Manager are visible here. Select the Mongo Blueprint and click Launch . Fill in the application name and click on Launch This picture showed the successful launch of the application Takeaways By using pre-seeded Blueprints from the Nutanix Marketplace, userscan quickly try out new applications. Marketplace Blueprints can be cloned and modified to suit a user's needs. For example, the pre-seeded LAMP Blueprint could be a starting point for a developer looking to swap PHP for a Go application server. Marketplace Blueprints can use local disk images or automatically download associated disk images. Users can create their own keys and slipstream them into Blueprints (via cloud-init) to control access. Developers can publish Blueprints to the Marketplace for fast and easy consumption by users. Blueprints can be launched directly from the Marketplace with no additional configuration from users, delivering a public cloud-like SaaS experience for end users. Administrators have control over what Blueprints are published to the Marketplace and which projects have access to published Blueprints.","title":"Calm Marketplace"},{"location":"calm_marketplace/calm_marketplace/#overview","text":"In this exercise you will learn how to manage Calm Blueprints within the Nutanix Marketplace.

Fully integrated into the Nutanix platform, Calm delivers a powerful, common management framework that can be simultaneously leveraged by multiple IT teams to rapidly create and deliver applications. Calm allows IT to expose the underlying infrastructure across multiple clouds as services the development and the business team can consume easily. Calm: Application Lifecycle Automation Blueprints Capture All Elements of the Application Make Sense of Complexity in a Visual Way Capture organizational knowledge Streamline provisioning and lifecycle tasks Easy to understand dependencies Blueprints Are Flexible and Open Utilize existing Bash or Powershell scripts Call any external service using REST API Blueprints Are Used for Lifecycle Management Automate routine application management operations Reduce errors,delays and downtime Calm: Self-Service and Governance Nutanix Marketplace Empowers Self-Service One-Click App Provisioning Pre-integrated blueprints Self-service based on user role and group Deploy in One-Click End-to-End Audits and Governance Calm: Hybrid Cloud Management Hybrid Cloud Management Deploy across Clouds Based on Need Cloud destination is configured once, then used with any blueprint Automate. Empower. Relax Takeaways Calms Native Capabilities: Application Lifecycle Management: Fully automate the provisioning, scaling, and deletion of both traditional multi-tiered applications and modern distributed services using pre-integrated blueprints that make management of applications in private and public clouds extremely simple. Customizable Blueprints: Simplify the set-up and management of custom enterprise applications by incorporating all elements of each app, including relevant VMs, configurations and related binaries, into an easy-to-use-blueprint that is managed by the infrastructure team. IT teams can eliminate the hours and days currently devoted to routine application management. Nutanix Marketplace: Blueprints can be published directly to end users through the Nutanix Marketplace, giving application owners and developers the ability to request IT services that can then be instantly provisioned. Governance: Calm maintains control with role-based governance that limits user operations based on permissions. Additionally, all activities and changes are centrally logged for end-to-end traceability, aiding security teams with key compliance initiatives. Hybrid Cloud Management: Automate the provisioning of Hybrid Cloud architectures, scaling both multi-tiered and distributed applications across different cloud environments, including AWS. Calm shows the overall utilization and true cost of your public cloud consumption at a glance so that decisions are based on business needs and budget requirements.","title":"What is Calm"},{"location":"what_is_calm/what_is_calm/#overview","text":"Calm provides advanced application-level orchestration that transforms how IT teams manage applications and support the business.
